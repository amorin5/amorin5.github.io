Project website for CS639 Final Project. We used computer vision via machine learning to automatically detect potholes. Then, that model is run over live video, uploaded photos, or uploaded video in order to automate the process of road surveying. Finally, the uploaded data is scanned for metadata which populates an interactive map to optimize the road repair process. 

Note: the code for the interactive map and the code for the web app are also hosted in this repo. The web app is located in the YOLOv5-flask folder.
