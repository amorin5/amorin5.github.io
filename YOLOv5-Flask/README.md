this is the part that has our model + runs it using flask. To run, do the following:

set up a virtual environment (venv). I prefer to use VSCode, for which there's a command in the command palette that does this for you.
make sure to have pip set up, and do `pip install -r requirements.txt` to have all necessary packages.
lastly, run flask run and it should start up your server.
