      Pothole repairs are the most common form of road repairs. Unrepaired potholes can cause collisions, injury, and even death. Because of this, we wanted to improve the process through automated detection, location, and mapping. Click through the tabs to see why we wanted to tackle this issue, how we went about it, what our results are, and what problems we overcame.
