        For my LIS 351 project, I created a 3d visual representation of a printing press for this project using only javascript and HTML. It only utilizes a single vector/matrix library (glMatrix https://glmatrix.net/) to help with matrix operations. The 3D graphic is roughly 300 lines of code, and the source code can be viewed by using inspect element on this webpage. I used visual studio code to program the project. I got the inspiration for this project from my computer graphics class which uses this basic javascript and HTML to teach elementary computer graphic concepts. I really enjoy coding the matrix operations and drawing using only lines and shading. 
The reason I chose to show the printing press was because it was one of the topics that caught my interest during the course. Being able to physically interact and use one in class to print material was one of my favorite lessons in the course. I found it quite interesting that there was quite a bit of technique that was needed in order to get a decent print. I used too much pressure when pressing the ink to the paper which resulted in the typing breaking the surface of the paper. If too little pressure is used then not all of the ink will be transferred onto the paper. Another reason I chose to model the printing press is that it is possible to model it without the use of modern 3D graphic libraries (or an insane amount of work). 
The printing press I created is a 3D rendering of Gutenberg’s printing press. In order to get a somewhat accurate representation of a printing press, I looked at several sources that had pictures and descriptions of what the printing press looked like. Although the printing press can come in all shapes and sizes, they all roughly follow the same pattern. It consists of a table with a stamping press on one end and a folding table on the other. In order to print on a piece of paper, one had to follow a number of intricate steps. First, one had to set up typing on a plate. Next, the ink had to be applied to the typing. After that, a piece of paper would be put on the folding table (the diagonal part shown in the model) and securely fastened to it. They used a pin that would poke through the paper to keep it aligned. Next, the part would be folded onto the inked type. It would then be pushed underneath the stamping press which someone would press crank the press down. Afterward, the press would be lifted and the folding table would be removed and the paper could be retrieved by opening the folding mechanism up. Gutenberg’s press was different than some of the earlier models of the printing press where Gutenberg replaced the wood printing blocks with metal and the individual type with metal which allowed it to be moved around, thus creating the moveable type.
