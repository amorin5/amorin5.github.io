I'm currently a Computer Science major at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I enjoy coding, running, biking, EDM, chess, anime, and playing video games. Right now I'm trying to improve my HTML & CSS skills by helping code the FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) Club's [website](https://fossclub-uw.org/) here at UW-Madison. 

Last summer I interned at Capital One as a Technology Internship Program intern, where I worked in the Software Architecture team. I designed and built a microservice API using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, written in Typescript which allowed internal developers to search and find specific software requirements in the Financial Services LOB.
