There are 55 million potholes in the U.S. alone, causing 27% of the roads to be deemed substandard. Potholes can cause collisions and severe injuries to all types of vehicles, including cyclists and pedestrians. Places with cold climates, such as Wisconsin, are especially susceptible to potholes as they form easily due to water and snow seeping into cracks and freezing during the night. Currently, the only way used to identify potholes on roads involves having a person manually inspect and report potholes they come across. This can lead to potholes going undetected and is also an inefficient way of gathering data. In order to save taxpayer money and government resources, we can identify potholes from drone and CCTV footage using computer vision. By using computer vision, we can automate the detection process of potholes, simplifying the collection of data necessary to determine how best to allocate infrastructure funds. This would lead to potholes getting noticed earlier and thus fixed faster.
